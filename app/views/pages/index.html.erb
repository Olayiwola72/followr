              <p>Twitter likes to restrict Followr's access to read-only every once-in-a-while. When that happens you'll need to come back and sign in and update your preferences.</p>

              <p>You're bound to get bots following you. You are after all a bot yourself now, no?</p>
              <p>You can come back anytime to stop/start following people</p>
              <p>You can come back anytime to manually unfollow people</p>

              <p>Looking for a front-end dev. Hit me up on twitter if you want in on this action</p>
              <p>Seriously though. I'm no designer. This site looks horrible.</p>
