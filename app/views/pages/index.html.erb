              <p>Followr is a Twitter bot created in hopes of increasing your social audience. Ok, mine too</p>
              <p>1. Enter a few hashtags you want to start following people from</p>
              <p>2. Enter how many days you want to wait until you unfollow them</p>
              <p>3. Done. Within 10 minutes Followr will go to work on your account. You're account will start following 60 people/hour, or 1,000 people/day and unfollow them a few days later.</p>
              <p><i class='glyphicon glyphicon-check'></i> Followr mutes everyone you follow so your feed consists of the stuff from the users you want to see, while keeping out potential spam</p>
              <p><i class='glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign'></i> Increase your social audience. You follow > they follow > you unfollow > win.</p>
